<p>You guys know that if you do the work, you work hard enough, dreams come true.</p>
<p>You know that, we all know that.</p>
<p>But hopefully what you get from tonight is that those times when you get up early and you work hard;</p>
<p>those times when you stay up late and you work hard;</p>
<p>those times when don’t feel like working — you’re too tired,</p>
<p>you don’t want to push yourself — but you do it anyway.</p>
<p>That is actually the dream.</p>
<p>That’s the dream.</p>
<p>It’s not the destination, it’s the journey.</p>
<p>And if you guys can understand that, what you’ll see happen is that you won’t accomplish your dreams, your dreams won’t come true, something greater will.</p>
